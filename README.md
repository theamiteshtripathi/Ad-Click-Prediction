# Predicting Website Ad Clicks - Data Mining Project

This project aims to predict website ad clicks using various data mining techniques. It is created by Amitesh Tripathi.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict if a website ad will be clicked or not. This is achieved by using a variety of data mining techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling. The project concludes with an evaluation of the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `DM_Project_Report_Group16_CTR.docx`: The project report provides a detailed explanation of the problem setting, data sources, data description, data collection, data processing, data exploration, data visualization, data mining model selection, evaluation of data mining models, and results.

- `Group_16_Project_CTR_Prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook includes all the code for the project. It is divided into several sections:

    - **Importing Libraries**: This section includes all the necessary libraries required for data analysis and modeling.
    
    - **Importing and Exploring the Dataset**: In this section, the dataset is loaded and a preliminary exploration is performed to understand the structure of the data.
    
    - **Data Pre-processing and Feature Engineering**: This section involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming features to make them suitable for modeling.
    
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this section, the data is analyzed in depth to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.
    
    - **Feature Selection & Feature Scaling**: This section involves selecting relevant features for modeling and scaling the features to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
    
    - **Data Modeling**: This section involves building the predictive model using appropriate algorithms.
    
    - **Model Evaluation**: In this section, the performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
    
    - **Conclusion**: This section provides a summary of the project and the results obtained.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `Group_16_Project_CTR_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter notebook.
3. Run all cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis and generate the model.

## Notes
